%\section{Experiments}
%In this part, our model, Real-time Ensemble Estimation Model(\emph{REEM}), are evaluated using the climate data and the air quality data from mobile sensor system(Fig.\ref{fig:display}). The performance of \emph{REEM} is compared with the state-of-art interpolation models, e.g. standard \emph{GPR}, \emph{Kriging}, \emph{IDW}, \emph{NOM} and \emph{LGP}. Especially, the kernel function of standard \emph{GPR} is same with \emph{REEM}. The goal of models is to estimate the concentration of $PM_{2.5}$ at any given location.

%\subsection{Data Set from Mobile Sensor System}
%Our data set is from June 1st, 2015 to September 29th of totally 121 days, whose data sampling frequency is high for about 2 times per minute. The monitoring data is comprised of the sampling time, the concentration of $PM_{2.5}$, longitude and latitude. During this period, there are 51 mobile devices collecting data on road, while only several devices work at the same time. The number of records per day in June are shown in Fig\ref{fig:perday}, where the number is considerable and relatively stable. We also make an experiment to get the distribution of the number of records at every timestamp during one day. As shown in Fig\ref{fig:oneday}, the amount of records at different times fluctuates greatly, which is a challenge to real-time model.

%Based on the aforementioned analysis, in order to verify the validity and feasibility of models under different sampling densities, we take every one hour data as a segment and cluster these segments into several classes according to data volume. We validate models through 10-fold cross-validation.

%\subsection{Kernel Selection}
%The Mean Average Error(\emph{MAE}) of the evaluation on different variables combinations is presented in Table\ref{tab:kCombination}. The performance of spatial feature is good. Additionally, the great improvement generated by the incorporation of time feature, which is in line with our conclusion that mobile data has strong spatio-temporal adjacent similarity. As well as the improvement generated by the inclusion of all of them. So, the input features we choose for our model consist of time, longitude, latitude, temperature, rain, pressure, humidity.

%\subsection{Accuracy Comparison}
%Fig.\ref{fig:performance} shows the Logarithm Root Mean Square Error(\emph{LRMSE}) of evaluation on the test set for each size training set. As we can see from Fig.\ref{fig:performance}, the performance of \emph{LGP} is better than other models just when the training set is 100. This phenomenon is related with the strategy of LGP, which is a continuous online regression model and retrain model as long as a new observation is attained. The way of real time update alleviates the disadvantage of sparse information, while wastes the computing resource when data is enough. Besides, our model \emph{REEM}, which is based on ensembling local information, is superior to \emph{standard GPR}. This is follow the idea of ensemble learning which a set of weak learners based on local information can acquire more strong generalization ability. All in all, The estimation performance of our model is well. In most cases, the accuracy of our model outperforms other classic interpolation models, e.g. \emph{GPR}, \emph{Kriging} and \emph{IDW}, also is slightly better than online models, like \emph{LGP} and \emph{ONM}. Here, the \emph{LRMSE} is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
%LRMSE = log\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{k=1}^n(y_{estimation}-y_{ground})^2}{n}}
%\label{equ:lrmse}
%\end{equation}

%\subsection{Time Cost Comparison}
%As to real-time model, time cost, usually consisting of training cost and estimating cost, is a crucial criterion. Since LGP and IDW are online training model, Fig.\ref{fig:trainingtime} just illustrates the training time comparison among OEEM, GPR and Kriging, where we can see our model have obvious advantages. Besides, considering the average time in millisecond needed for estimation of 1 query point shown in Table\ref{tab:testingtime}, OEEM outperforms standard GPR, LGP and Kriging while being close to IDW.
